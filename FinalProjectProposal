Project Proposal:

Using twitter data, train a classifier to associate tweets with the following metadata:

Age
Gender
Age Range
YearOfBirth

Once that is done, see if I can extract the rules the classifier has used to determine a users metadata and see if tweets can be modified in a specific way so that they are now classified as a certain age/gender
