As we know it, irony is unique to humans. 

Current nlp methods rely too heavily on
shallow, unstructured, syntactic modeling of text to consistently discern ironic intent.


Irony detection requires semantics that cannot be inffered from word counts alone

Definition of Irony: the expression of one's meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite, typically for humorous or emphatic effect.

Simply put its a when the speaker says the opposite of what they mean

Definition of Sarcasm: the use of irony to mock or convey contempt.

What are the papers exploring? What were the commonalities and differences?
- They all explored sarcasm, common theme is that they all identify sarcasm as a very hard problem but humans do it with ease.
- Children as young as 6 are able to do it (Pexman and Glenwright 2007).
- Accuractely classifying sarcasm could significantly improve models for sentiment analysis(Davidov et al. 2010; Tepperman et al. 2006), (Pang and Lee 2004).
- Example classifying negative or postive reviews, verbal irony is responsible for many of the errors made by state-of-the-art methods for this
task (Carvalho et al. 2009); 
- Furthermore any model hoping to truly understand human text must distingush between
the sincere and ironic texts 

    What are the papers exploring? What were the commonalities and differences?
    How did they explore the topic? (i.e. what was the methodology?) How did they differ?
    What did they find and contribute?
    What was good about the papers? What was bad?
